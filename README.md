# Basic-Banking-System

I  was a web developer and i was given a task to build a local host website which would show the transaction between customers of a bank and also maintain a  database and show updating the accounts after transaction in the website and as well as in the database. technologies used - HTML, CSS, PHP,  SQL.

This application allows transactions between costumers of a bank.
A detailed database is maintained using a local server created using XAMPP.
I have used HTML & CSS for the designing purpose of the website.
I have used PHP to connect the database from server to the website.
XAMPP is used to create a local database which gets updated whenever a transaction is made.
