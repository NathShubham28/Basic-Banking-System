# Basic-Banking-System

This application allows transactions between costumers of a bank.
A detailed database is maintained using a local server created using XAMPP.
I have used HTML & CSS for the designing purpose of the website.
I have used PHP to connect the database from server to the website.
XAMPP is used to create a local database which gets updated whenever a transaction is made.
