I was a web developer and i was given a task to build a localhost website that would show the transaction between customers of a bank and also maintain a database and show updating the accounts after the transaction in the website and as well as in the database. technologies used - HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL.

This application allows transactions between customers of a bank. 
A detailed database is maintained using a local server created using XAMPP. 
I have used HTML & CSS for the designing purpose of the website. 
I have used PHP to connect the database from the server to the website. 
XAMPP is used to create a local database that gets updated whenever a transaction is made.
